Raw data: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17iZj6EE72_VXDpjPcio5dHsnUL9eDRle
In the data set, there are three types of data, each with 20 files, corresponding to different values of b (b = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,20, 30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100})

Taking the video source as an example, select three different b and analyze their time series. It can be found that as b increases, the waiting time becomes significantly longer and is unstable.
